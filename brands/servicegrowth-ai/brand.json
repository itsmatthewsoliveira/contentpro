Small tracked uppercase category labels above headlines. IMAGERY: Two modes — (1) Pop art and cultural references as bold visual backdrops with text overlaid, or (2) 3D chrome rendered assets as concept metaphors. When showcasing work, display generated images/renders as portfolio pieces within the slide.
